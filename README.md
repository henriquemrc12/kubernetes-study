# Kubernetes Studies

### In this study, two applications were developed, the Producer and the Consumer

#### Producer
`The producer application was created to receive a value in the endpoint "/send/{value}" and send the message with Apache kafka to the Consumer application`

#### Consumer
`The consumer application was created to receive the message from Apache kafka and then insert it into Database`
